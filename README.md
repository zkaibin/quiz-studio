## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Character Substitution Works

Questions use placeholders like `{CHARACTER_0}`, `{CHARACTER_1}` which are dynamically replaced with characters from your selected theme. The system ensures:

- **No duplicate characters** in the same question
- **Role-appropriate selection** (protagonist, helper, antagonist, etc.)
- **Theme filtering** - only shows characters from selected universe

Example:
```
Template: "{CHARACTER_0} has {num1} apples. {CHARACTER_1} gives them {num2} more."

With Disney theme becomes:
"Mickey Mouse has 5 apples. Minnie Mouse gives him 3 more."

With Dragon Ball theme becomes:
"Goku has 5 apples. Vegeta gives him 3 more."
```

### Data Format

All data is stored in JSON files:

**Questions** (`data/questions-*.json`):
```json
{
  "id": "Q760",
  "category": "Fractions",
  "difficulty": "PSLE",
  "template": "{CHARACTER_0} has a bag of 120 marbles...",
  "placeholder_roles": ["protagonist", "helper", "hero"],
  "options": ["54", "48", "36", "60"],
  "answer": 0,
  "correct_answer": "54"
}
```

**Characters** (`data/characters.json`):
```json

  "roles": ["protagonist", "hero", "leader"]
}
```

     "description": "Brief description"
   }
   ```

3. **Add characters** to `characters.json` with the new `universe_id`

4. **Update README** with the new universe and character count

### Validating Questions
